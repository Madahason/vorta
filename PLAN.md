# Vorta — Project Plan

## What is Vorta?
Vorta is an AI-powered content production platform. The current build focuses on the **Video Creator** module: a fully automated pipeline that transforms a YouTube documentary script into a near-finished video using AI-generated images, motion graphics, and a pre-built clip library — assembled programmatically via Remotion.

The platform is designed to scale. Future modules (Video Research, Title & Thumbnail Generator, Script Writer) will slot into the same UI without requiring a rebuild.

---

## Vision: Full Platform (Future)
The sidebar navigation should reflect all planned modules, with future ones marked as "Coming soon":

1. **Video Research** — finds winning video ideas, identifies angles and content gaps
2. **Script Writer** — transforms a video idea + title + thumbnail concept into a full documentary script
3. **Title & Thumbnail** — generates optimized titles and thumbnail concepts based on winning ideas
4. **Video Creator** ← current build
5. **Settings** — style presets, library management, auth status

---

## Current Build: Video Creator

### Pipeline Overview
```
Script Input
→ Claude Scene Analyzer (classify + prompt each scene)
→ Scene JSON
→ [Image scenes] → Higgsfield CLI → still image + Ken Burns in Remotion
→ [Motion graphic scenes] → Remotion component templates
→ [Real footage scenes] → Clip Library match → fallback: Higgsfield CLI image
→ Remotion Assembler (timeline + transitions + audio)
→ MP4 Export
```

### Scene Types
Every scene is classified as one of three types:
- `image` — Higgsfield CLI generates a still; Remotion animates with Ken Burns effect
- `motion_graphic` — Remotion renders a pre-built animated component (chart, counter, timeline, quote card, map)
- `real_footage` — matched against local clip library by tags; falls back to `image` if no match found

### Scene JSON Structure
```json
{
  "scene_id": "007",
  "script_excerpt": "The moment Lehman collapsed...",
  "shot_type": "image",
  "mood": "tense",
  "higgsfield_prompt": "Traders on the Lehman Brothers trading floor in Midtown Manhattan clearing personal belongings on September 15 2008, shocked expressions, cardboard boxes, LHMAN ticker plummeting on screens behind them",
  "subject_anchors": ["Lehman Brothers", "September 15 2008", "trading floor", "financial crisis"],
  "style_lock": "dark cinematic 4K shallow depth of field slow dolly documentary",
  "real_footage_flag": false,
  "clip_search_tags": [],
  "duration_seconds": 5,
  "motion": { "type": "static", "intensity": "moderate" },
  "overlays": [{ "type": "date_stamp", "text": "New York · September 2008" }],
  "transition_out": "dip_black",
  "grade": "desaturated"
}
```

### Documentary Composition Layer (added Phase 2 polish)

Each image scene carries full composition metadata assigned by Claude and overridable per-card in the UI.

**`motion`** — controls the camera animation applied to the still image:

| type | use when |
|------|----------|
| `push_in` | building tension, approaching a subject, reveals |
| `pull_out` | showing scale, consequences, stepping back |
| `drift_left` / `drift_right` | establishing shots, locations, timelines |
| `drift_up` | aspirational moments, launches, achievements |
| `static` | death, failure, shock — stillness has impact |

intensity: `subtle` (background), `moderate` (main narrative), `strong` (climax/turning points)

Scale/translate ranges:
- push_in: scale 1.0 → 1.06 / 1.10 / 1.16
- pull_out: scale 1.06 → 1.0 / 1.10 → 1.0 / 1.16 → 1.0
- drift_*: translate 0 → ±4% / ±7% / ±10%
- static: no transform

**`overlays`** — array of overlay specs rendered on top of the image:
- `lower_third` — person/company introduction, slides in from left, holds 3s, slides out
- `date_stamp` — year/location pill, bottom-right, fades in and stays
- `kinetic_text` — punchy statement, center or bottom, fade in/hold/fade out. Max 1 per 4 scenes.

Rules: never lower_third AND date_stamp on same scene. Leave `[]` for atmospheric scenes.

**`transition_out`** — how the scene exits:
- `dissolve` — 12-frame cross-fade overlap (default)
- `cut` — hard cut, no overlap
- `dip_black` — 8-frame black frame (chapter breaks, deaths, endings)
- `dip_white` — 8-frame white frame (reveals, memory sequences)

**`grade`** — color grade applied via FilmLook overlay:
- `cool_blue` — default documentary grade (rgba(30,60,120,0.12) multiply)
- `warm_amber` — historical/nostalgia (rgba(120,80,20,0.10) multiply)
- `desaturated` — crisis/failure (CSS saturate(0.6))
- `neutral` — product shots/clean context (no tint)

**FilmLook overlay** (`remotion/src/components/overlays/FilmLook.jsx`) — applied to every image scene:
- Animated grain: 512×512 canvas redrawn per frame with frame-seeded PRNG, scaled up via CSS
- Vignette: radial-gradient div, default intensity 0.45
- Color grade tint: multiply blend div

**Remotion project** (`remotion/`):
- Entry: `remotion/src/index.jsx` → `Root.jsx` → registers Documentary composition
- `Documentary.jsx` computes layout (start frames per scene based on transitions) and sequences all scenes with `<Sequence>`
- `ImageScene.jsx` applies motion transform + FilmLook + overlay components
- Each overlay component: `LowerThird.jsx`, `DateStamp.jsx`, `KineticText.jsx`
- Install: `cd remotion && npm install`
- Preview: `npm start` (opens Remotion Studio)
- Render: `npm run render`

### Style Lock
Every Higgsfield prompt must include the style lock string to enforce visual consistency across all scenes:
> "dark cinematic 4K shallow depth of field slow dolly movement documentary aesthetic muted tones"

This string is injected automatically by the backend service — never rely on Claude to remember it per scene.

### Prompt Grounding Rules
Claude is instructed to generate prompts that are anchored to the specific subject of the video — not generic cinematic stand-ins. The system prompt enforces:

1. **Subject anchoring** — every image prompt must reference the actual subject (real company, product, person, place) not a generic substitute
2. **Script anchoring** — the prompt describes what is literally happening in the excerpt, not a thematic interpretation
3. **Specificity** — real place names, years, product names, people described by appearance/role
4. **Banned concepts** — the words `businessman`, `office`, `technology`, `modern`, `futuristic`, `abstract`, `concept`, `idea`, `success`, `growth`, `innovation`, `digital`, `corporate`, `professional` are explicitly forbidden

**`subject_anchors` field** — Claude extracts 3–6 specific real-world entities per scene (company names, person names, product names, locations, years, events). At least 2 must appear directly in the `higgsfield_prompt`. A post-processing validator in `claude.js` checks this on every image scene and appends the top anchor if the check fails.

### Clip Library Structure
Each clip entry in the library:
```json
{
  "clip_id": "001",
  "file": "/library/clips/wall_street_crowd.mp4",
  "tags": ["finance", "wall street", "crowd", "crisis", "2008"],
  "mood": "tense",
  "category": "finance",
  "duration": 6,
  "source_url": "https://youtube.com/..."
}
```

Library is stored as a flat JSON file (`/library/clips.json`) alongside the clip files.

### Remotion Motion Graphic Templates
Pre-built components to build and maintain:
- `AnimatedCounter` — counts up to a number (revenue, users, dates)
- `TimelineBar` — horizontal event timeline
- `ComparisonChart` — side-by-side bar or stat comparison
- `QuoteCard` — full-screen pull quote with animated text
- `MapHighlight` — world/country map with highlighted region

---

## Higgsfield CLI Integration

### Overview
Higgsfield is integrated via their official CLI package — NOT via direct REST API calls. The CLI handles authentication, uploads, and async polling automatically.

### Installation
```bash
npm install -g @higgsfield/cli
```

### Authentication
Authentication is handled by the CLI itself via device-code OAuth — no API key needed in `.env`:
```bash
higgsfield auth login
# Opens browser, authenticates in ~5 seconds
# Session is persisted — run once, valid indefinitely
```

### How the backend calls it
The Node.js backend service (`server/services/higgsfield.js`) spawns CLI commands via `child_process.exec`. Never call the Higgsfield REST API directly.

```javascript
// server/services/higgsfield.js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const { promisify } = require('util');
const execAsync = promisify(exec);

// cmd.exe-safe quoting: wrap in double quotes, escape internal " as ""
function quoteCmdArg(str) {
  return '"' + str.replace(/"/g, '""') + '"';
}

async function generateImage(prompt, model = 'nano_banana_2') {
  const cmd = [
    'higgsfield generate create',
    model,
    '--prompt', quoteCmdArg(prompt),
    '--aspect_ratio 16:9',
    '--resolution 2k',
    '--wait',
  ].join(' ');

  const { stdout } = await execAsync(cmd, { timeout: 360_000 });
  const url = stdout.trim();
  if (!url.startsWith('http')) throw new Error(`Unexpected output: ${url.slice(0, 200)}`);
  return url; // plain URL string, not JSON
}
```

### CLI Command Reference (used in Vorta)
```bash
higgsfield auth login              # Authenticate (run once)
higgsfield account                 # Check credit balance
higgsfield model list              # List all available models
higgsfield generate create <model> # Submit job — model is a positional arg, not a flag
higgsfield generate list           # List past generations
higgsfield upload image            # Upload reference image (returns UUID)
```

### Actual generate command (confirmed working)
```bash
higgsfield generate create nano_banana_2 \
  --prompt "..." \
  --aspect_ratio 16:9 \
  --resolution 2k \
  --wait
```
`--wait` blocks until generation is complete and prints the image URL directly to stdout as a plain string (not JSON). No separate `wait` or `get` step needed.

### Available models (job set types from `higgsfield model list`)

**Active:**

| Job set type | Display name | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `nano_banana_2` | Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro) | Default — highest quality (`MODELS.default`) |
| `nano_banana_flash` | Nano Banana 2 | Fast tier — drafts (`MODELS.fast`) |

Note: the job set type `nano_banana_2` resolves to the product named "Nano Banana Pro". The names are counter-intuitive — always use the job set type, not the display name.

**Confirmed available — commented options for future use:**

| Job set type | Best for |
|---|---|
| `cinematic_studio_2_5` | Cinematic/film-tuned; good alternative for documentary B-roll |
| `flux_kontext` | Precise subject placement, complex prompt following |
| `seedream_v4_5` | Painterly/editorial mood; good for historical or atmospheric scenes |
| `veo3`, `veo3_1` | Video generation — reserved for future optional video scenes |

To switch model without a code change: set `HIGGSFIELD_MODEL=<job_set_type>` in `.env` and restart the server.

### Key behaviours
- Authentication session is persisted locally by the CLI — no token management needed in code
- `--wait` makes generation synchronous from the caller's perspective — stdout is the final image URL
- stdout is a plain URL string, NOT JSON — do not `JSON.parse()` it
- On Windows, `child_process.exec` runs through `cmd.exe` — use `""` quoting (not `\"`): `'"' + str.replace(/"/g, '""') + '"'`
- Credits use the same system as the Higgsfield platform (Plus plan: unlimited image models)
- No API key in `.env` for Higgsfield — remove `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` entirely

## Build Phases

### Phase 1 — Script input + Claude scene analyzer ✅ COMPLETE
- Script paste/upload UI
- Project metadata form (title, niche, style preset, narrator tone)
- Claude API integration: script → scene JSON array
- Scene grid display with type badges and generated prompts
- Manual override: edit any scene's shot type or prompt before generation

**Deviations from original plan:**
- Model updated to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (original `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` deprecated June 2026)
- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` added to `.env` for local dev — Node.js does not trust the local CA certificate on this machine; must be removed before any production deployment
- Vite proxy (`/api → localhost:3001`) added to `client/vite.config.js`

### Phase 2 — Higgsfield image generation ✅ COMPLETE
- Loop through `image` scenes, call Higgsfield CLI via child_process
- Live generation progress grid (per-scene status: pending / generating / done / failed)
- Preview images inline per scene card
- Regenerate individual scenes
- Auto-download and save images to `/projects/[id]/assets/`

**Deviations from original plan:**
- Higgsfield CLI command syntax differs significantly from PLAN.md. Final confirmed working approach:
  - Single `--wait` command replaces the three-step create/wait/get flow entirely
  - Model is a **positional argument**: `higgsfield generate create nano_banana_2 --prompt "..." --aspect_ratio 16:9 --resolution 2k --wait`
  - stdout is a **plain URL string**, not JSON — do not parse it
  - Model used: `nano_banana_2` (PLAN.md originally said `soul`; that model does not exist; `nano_banana_2` used in early sessions, upgraded to `nano_banana_2` for production quality)
  - `nano_banana_2` retained as `MODELS.fast` for draft generation
  - On Windows, `cmd.exe` quoting requires `""` escaping (not bash-style `\"`) — `quoteCmdArg()` handles this
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) used for live per-scene progress updates — no extra library, uses browser's native `EventSource`
- `EventSource` must connect directly to Express (`http://localhost:3001`), NOT through Vite proxy — Vite's http-proxy buffers `text/event-stream` responses
- Projects static files served via `express.static` at `/projects` route
- `generate.js` in-memory `store` Map resets on server restart — clients receive 404 on SSE reconnect if server was restarted mid-generation

### Browser Persistence (localStorage) — added in Phase 2 polish

All Video Creator state survives a page refresh via `localStorage`. No backend changes required — images are already saved to `/projects/[id]/assets/` on the filesystem and remain accessible as long as the server is running.

**Keys written:**

| Key | Contents | Managed by |
|-----|----------|------------|
| `vorta_scenes` | Full scenes array (prompts, shot types, manual overrides) | `VideoCreator.jsx` |
| `vorta_project_id` | Current project ID string | `VideoCreator.jsx` |
| `vorta_scene_statuses` | Per-scene `{ status, image_path, error }` — images reappear on load | `VideoCreator.jsx` |
| `vorta_script_metadata` | `{ title, niche, stylePreset, narratorTone, script }` | `ScriptInput.jsx` |
| `vorta_motion_components` | Reserved for Phase 4 Remotion component code per scene | unused |

**Behaviour:**
- State is lazy-initialised from localStorage before first render — scenes, statuses, and images appear instantly on reload
- `isAnalyzing` and `isGenerating` are **never** persisted — they always reset to `false` on load to prevent a stuck spinner
- `generateDone` is derived on load from persisted statuses (true if all image scenes are done/failed)
- All reads are wrapped in `try/catch` — any parse or quota error silently starts a fresh session
- A subtle **"Session restored"** badge appears in the header for 3 seconds when saved data is detected on load (fades out with CSS transition)
- A **"Clear session"** button in the header wipes all `vorta_*` keys and resets all state to blank, including force-remounting `ScriptInput` via React `key` prop

### Phase 3 — Clip library + matching ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Clip library browser UI (search, filter by category/mood/tags)
- Auto-match `real_footage` scenes against library tags
- Show top 3 candidates per scene, user picks or skips
- Fallback: auto-convert unmatched scenes to `image` type
- Gap logger: records unmatched tags to help grow the library

**What works (confirmed):**
- All backend endpoints confirmed working: `GET /api/library`, `GET /api/library/gaps`, `POST /api/library/match`, `POST /api/library/match-all`, `POST /api/library/add`, `DELETE /api/library/:clip_id`
- `gaps.json` logging with deduplication
- Clip Library slide-in panel (search, filters, Add Clip form, delete with confirm, gap insights footer)
- "Convert to image" fallback on scene cards
- 16 seed clips in library (IDs 001–016) including Apple keynote, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, US Capitol, etc.

**Known issue — to fix after Phase 5:**
- Clip candidate cards do not render on `real_footage` scene cards despite the backend returning correct match results. Root cause: frontend state/props wiring between `VideoCreator.jsx` (`clipMatches`, `selectedClips` state) and `ClipMatchSection` in `SceneGrid.jsx`. The backend match logic is correct; this is a React state threading bug to be diagnosed and fixed as a follow-up.

**Implementation details:**
- `server/services/clipMatcher.js` — tag overlap scoring (+ 0.5 bonus for mood match), returns top 3
- `server/routes/library.js` — all CRUD + match endpoints; `GET /gaps` sorted most-recent-first; declared before `DELETE /:clip_id` to prevent Express param collision
- `library/gaps.json` — auto-written on zero matches; deduplicates by sorted tag set
- `library/clips.json` — 16 seed clips across finance, tech, politics, industry, cities, transportation categories
- Matching auto-fires via `POST /api/library/match-all` immediately after Claude analysis completes; also re-runs on page load if scenes are restored from localStorage but `clipMatches` is empty
- `clipMatches` and `selectedClips` persisted to `vorta_clip_matches` / `vorta_selected_clips` in localStorage
- `ClipLibrary.jsx` — 480px slide-in side panel with Add Clip form, delete-with-confirm, gap insights footer
- `ClipMatchSection` in `SceneGrid.jsx` — state/props wiring incomplete (see known issue above)

### Phase 4 — Remotion templates + Ken Burns ✅ COMPLETE
- Build all 5 motion graphic component templates
- Ken Burns implementation on ImageScene (varied zoom direction per scene to avoid repetition)
- Cross-dissolve transitions between scenes (8 frames)
- Audio track sync to scene durations

**Implementation details:**
- `AnimatedCounter.jsx` — spring-eased count-up with prefix/suffix, comma formatting, animated underline
- `TimelineBar.jsx` — horizontal timeline with staggered dot reveals, year labels above, event labels below
- `ComparisonChart.jsx` — vertical bar chart with spring grow animation per bar, value label above each bar
- `QuoteCard.jsx` — full-screen pull quote in serif italic with fade+slide entrance, attribution line
- `MapHighlight.jsx` — SVG world map with pulsing dot marker at lat/lng coordinate and region label
- All templates registered as individual Remotion Studio compositions for preview
- `Documentary.jsx` updated: motion_graphic scenes dispatched to correct template via `MotionGraphicScene` dispatcher using `scene.motion_graphic_type` and `scene.motion_graphic_props`
- Ken Burns: `ImageScene.jsx` uses `scene.motion.type` + `scene.motion.intensity` to drive scale/translate transforms via `interpolate()` — direction varies per scene as set by Claude
- Transitions: dissolve (12-frame cross-fade opacity), cut (no overlap), dip_black/dip_white (8-frame solid frame inserted between scenes)
- Film look: `FilmLook.jsx` applies animated grain (canvas PRNG per frame), vignette, and color grade tint on every image scene

### Phase 5 — Full pipeline integration + render
- End-to-end flow: script in → MP4 out
- Render trigger via Remotion CLI from backend
- Export panel with progress indicator
- Download final MP4

---

## UI Design Principles
- Dark sidebar navigation (all modules listed, future ones marked "Coming soon")
- Clean minimal content area — no clutter
- Scene grid is the central UI metaphor: each card shows scene number, excerpt, type badge, prompt, and asset preview
- Status indicators on every async operation (analyzing, generating, matching, rendering)
- Non-destructive: every Claude or Higgsfield output is editable before the next step runs

---

## Environment Variables
Only one key needed in `.env`:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
Higgsfield authentication is managed by the CLI session — no key required.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist (before first run)
1. `npm install -g @higgsfield/cli` — install CLI globally
2. `higgsfield auth login` — authenticate once
3. `higgsfield account` — verify credits are available
4. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env`
5. Node.js 18+ installed
6. Remotion dependencies installed in `/remotion`

---

## Channel Benchmarks (for style reference)
- MagnatesMedia, Wendover Productions, Economics Explained
- Narrator tone: Keith Morrison / Peter Coyote — authoritative, measured, cinematic
- Visual identity: dark, clinical, high-contrast motion graphics

---

## Notes for Claude Code Sessions
- Always read this file at the start of a session before writing any code
- Never install libraries not listed in the tech stack without flagging it first
- Higgsfield is called via CLI (child_process), never via direct HTTP/REST
- All Higgsfield prompts must include the style lock string — injected in higgsfield.js service, not in the prompt itself
- Scene JSON is the contract between all modules — do not change its structure without updating all consumers
- Remotion and the backend are separate Node.js projects with their own package.json files
- Never hardcode API keys — always read from .env via dotenv

---

## Session Workflow Rules
These rules apply to every Claude Code session without exception.

### Rule 1 — Session opener
Every session must begin with:
> "Read PLAN.md first, then we'll continue from where we left off."
Never skip this. It rebuilds full context and prevents conflicting decisions across sessions.

### Rule 2 — Phase completion
When a phase is fully working and tested, run:
> "Update PLAN.md to mark Phase X as complete and note anything we changed from the original plan."
PLAN.md is the single source of truth. Keep it accurate as the build evolves.

### Rule 3 — Git discipline
- Run `git init` immediately after the scaffold is created
- Connect to GitHub: `gh repo create vorta --private --source=. --push`
- Commit message format: `phase-X: short description of what was built`
- Commit after every completed phase before moving to the next
- Never commit `.env` — it must be in `.gitignore` from day one

### Rule 4 — Phase testing checklist
Before marking any phase complete, run through its testing checklist (defined per phase below). Do not proceed to the next phase until all checks pass.

---

## Phase Testing Checklists

### Scaffold + Layout
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts without errors on both client and server
- [ ] Browser shows dark sidebar with 5 navigation items
- [ ] Video Creator is active/highlighted
- [ ] Video Research, Script Writer, Title & Thumbnail show "Coming soon" badges
- [ ] Settings page is accessible
- [ ] Console shows no errors on load
- [ ] `.env` loads correctly — backend logs confirm ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is present (never log the key itself, just confirm it's truthy)
- [ ] `.gitignore` covers: `node_modules`, `.env`, `dist`, `build`, `.remotion`
- [ ] Initial commit pushed to GitHub

### Phase 1 — Script input + Claude scene analyzer
- [ ] Script paste textarea accepts and holds text
- [ ] Project metadata form saves: title, niche, style preset, narrator tone
- [ ] Clicking Analyze fires a request to `POST /api/analyze`
- [ ] Server logs confirm Claude API is receiving the script
- [ ] Response returns valid scene JSON array matching the structure in PLAN.md
- [ ] Scene grid renders with one card per scene
- [ ] Each card shows: scene number, script excerpt, shot type badge (image / motion_graphic / real_footage), generated Higgsfield prompt
- [ ] Style lock string is present in every image scene prompt
- [ ] Shot type badge colors are distinct (e.g. blue / teal / amber)
- [ ] Manual override works: editing a prompt updates the scene card
- [ ] Manual override works: changing shot type updates the badge
- [ ] Empty script shows a validation error, not a crash
- [ ] Phase 1 committed to GitHub: `phase-1: script input and Claude scene analyzer`

### Phase 2 — Higgsfield image generation
- [ ] Generate button appears only after Phase 1 scenes exist
- [ ] Clicking Generate loops through all `image` scenes only
- [ ] Each scene card shows status: pending → generating → done / failed
- [ ] `higgsfield generate create nano_banana_2 --wait` fires correctly (check server logs)
- [ ] Command blocks until complete and returns a plain image URL on stdout (not JSON)
- [ ] Image downloads and saves to `/projects/[id]/assets/[scene_id].jpg`
- [ ] Scene card displays the generated image on completion
- [ ] Regenerate button on individual cards works independently
- [ ] Failed scenes show an error state with a retry option
- [ ] `motion_graphic` and `real_footage` scenes are skipped (not sent to Higgsfield)
- [ ] Credit balance does not unexpectedly drain (check `higgsfield account` before and after)
- [ ] Phase 2 committed to GitHub: `phase-2: Higgsfield CLI image generation`

### Phase 3 — Clip library + matching
- [ ] `library/clips.json` loads correctly on server start
- [ ] At least 3 test clips exist in the library for testing
- [ ] `real_footage` scenes trigger a library search automatically
- [ ] Tag matching returns up to 3 candidate clips per scene
- [ ] Scene card shows candidate clips with thumbnails or filenames
- [ ] User can select one clip per scene
- [ ] Unmatched scenes automatically fall back to `image` type
- [ ] Gap logger records unmatched tag sets to a `library/gaps.json` file
- [ ] Clip library browser UI shows all clips, searchable by tag/category/mood
- [ ] Phase 3 committed to GitHub: `phase-3: clip library and scene matching`

### Phase 4 — Remotion templates + Ken Burns
- [ ] Remotion dev server starts inside `/remotion` without errors
- [ ] `ImageScene` component renders a still image with Ken Burns animation
- [ ] Zoom direction varies between scenes (not all zooming in the same direction)
- [ ] `AnimatedCounter` counts from 0 to target value with easing
- [ ] `TimelineBar` renders and animates correctly
- [ ] `ComparisonChart` renders side-by-side bars
- [ ] `QuoteCard` renders full-screen text with entrance animation
- [ ] `MapHighlight` renders with a highlighted region
- [ ] Cross-dissolve transition between scenes plays at 8 frames
- [ ] A test composition with 3–5 mixed scenes renders to MP4 without errors
- [ ] Audio track syncs to scene durations in the test render
- [ ] Phase 4 committed to GitHub: `phase-4: Remotion templates and Ken Burns`

### Phase 5 — Full pipeline integration + render
- [ ] End-to-end test: paste a short 3-scene script, run full pipeline, receive MP4
- [ ] Render is triggered from the Export panel button
- [ ] Progress indicator updates during render
- [ ] Completed MP4 is downloadable from the UI
- [ ] MP4 plays correctly in VLC or browser — no corrupted frames
- [ ] All three scene types (image, motion_graphic, real_footage) appear correctly in the output
- [ ] Transitions between scenes are smooth
- [ ] Audio is present and in sync
- [ ] Project files are saved to `/projects/[id]/` and persist across sessions
- [ ] Phase 5 committed to GitHub: `phase-5: full pipeline integration and MP4 export`
