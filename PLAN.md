# Vorta — Project Plan

## What is Vorta?
Vorta is an AI-powered content production platform. The current build focuses on the **Video Creator** module: a fully automated pipeline that transforms a YouTube documentary script into a near-finished video using AI-generated images, motion graphics, and a pre-built clip library — assembled programmatically via Remotion.

The platform is designed to scale. Future modules (Video Research, Title & Thumbnail Generator, Script Writer) will slot into the same UI without requiring a rebuild.

---

## Vision: Full Platform (Future)
The sidebar navigation should reflect all planned modules, with future ones marked as "Coming soon":

1. **Video Research** — finds winning video ideas, identifies angles and content gaps
2. **Script Writer** — transforms a video idea + title + thumbnail concept into a full documentary script
3. **Title & Thumbnail** — generates optimized titles and thumbnail concepts based on winning ideas
4. **Video Creator** ← current build
5. **Settings** — style presets, library management, auth status

---

## Current Build: Video Creator

### Pipeline Overview
```
Script Input
→ Claude Scene Analyzer (classify + prompt each scene)
→ Scene JSON
→ [Image scenes] → Higgsfield CLI → still image + Ken Burns in Remotion
→ [Motion graphic scenes] → Remotion component templates
→ [Real footage scenes] → Clip Library match → fallback: Higgsfield CLI image
→ Remotion Assembler (timeline + transitions + audio)
→ MP4 Export
```

### Scene Types
Every scene is classified as one of three types:
- `image` — Higgsfield CLI generates a still; Remotion animates with Ken Burns effect
- `motion_graphic` — Remotion renders a pre-built animated component (chart, counter, timeline, quote card, map)
- `real_footage` — matched against local clip library by tags; falls back to `image` if no match found

### Scene JSON Structure
```json
{
  "scene_id": "007",
  "script_excerpt": "The moment Lehman collapsed...",
  "shot_type": "image",
  "mood": "tense",
  "higgsfield_prompt": "Cinematic aerial view of empty Wall Street at dawn, 2008, dark moody grade, shallow depth of field, slow dolly movement",
  "style_lock": "dark cinematic 4K shallow depth of field slow dolly documentary",
  "real_footage_flag": false,
  "clip_search_tags": [],
  "duration_seconds": 5
}
```

### Style Lock
Every Higgsfield prompt must include the style lock string to enforce visual consistency across all scenes:
> "dark cinematic 4K shallow depth of field slow dolly movement documentary aesthetic muted tones"

This string is injected automatically by the backend service — never rely on Claude to remember it per scene.

### Clip Library Structure
Each clip entry in the library:
```json
{
  "clip_id": "001",
  "file": "/library/clips/wall_street_crowd.mp4",
  "tags": ["finance", "wall street", "crowd", "crisis", "2008"],
  "mood": "tense",
  "category": "finance",
  "duration": 6,
  "source_url": "https://youtube.com/..."
}
```

Library is stored as a flat JSON file (`/library/clips.json`) alongside the clip files.

### Remotion Motion Graphic Templates
Pre-built components to build and maintain:
- `AnimatedCounter` — counts up to a number (revenue, users, dates)
- `TimelineBar` — horizontal event timeline
- `ComparisonChart` — side-by-side bar or stat comparison
- `QuoteCard` — full-screen pull quote with animated text
- `MapHighlight` — world/country map with highlighted region

---

| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| AI Analysis | Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) |
| Image Generation | Higgsfield CLI (`@higgsfield/cli`) |
| Video Assembly | Remotion |
| Clip Library | JSON flat file + local filesystem |
| Clip Sourcing | yt-dlp (run separately, not in-app) |
| Rendering | Remotion CLI |

---

## Higgsfield CLI Integration

### Overview
Higgsfield is integrated via their official CLI package — NOT via direct REST API calls. The CLI handles authentication, uploads, and async polling automatically.

### Installation
```bash
npm install -g @higgsfield/cli
```

### Authentication
Authentication is handled by the CLI itself via device-code OAuth — no API key needed in `.env`:
```bash
higgsfield auth login
# Opens browser, authenticates in ~5 seconds
# Session is persisted — run once, valid indefinitely
```

### How the backend calls it
The Node.js backend service (`server/services/higgsfield.js`) spawns CLI commands via `child_process.exec`. Never call the Higgsfield REST API directly.

```javascript
// server/services/higgsfield.js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const { promisify } = require('util');
const execAsync = promisify(exec);

async function generateImage(prompt) {
  // 1. Submit generation job
  const { stdout: createOut } = await execAsync(
    `higgsfield generate create --prompt "${prompt}" --model soul`
  );
  const { job_id } = JSON.parse(createOut);

  // 2. Poll until complete
  await execAsync(`higgsfield generate wait --job-id ${job_id}`);

  // 3. Fetch result
  const { stdout: getOut } = await execAsync(
    `higgsfield generate get --job-id ${job_id}`
  );
  const { output_url } = JSON.parse(getOut);
  return output_url;
}
```

### CLI Command Reference (used in Vorta)
```bash
higgsfield auth login              # Authenticate (run once)
higgsfield account                 # Check credit balance
higgsfield model list              # List all available models
higgsfield generate create         # Submit a generation job
higgsfield generate wait           # Poll until job completes
higgsfield generate get            # Fetch completed result
higgsfield generate list           # List past generations
higgsfield upload image            # Upload reference image (returns UUID)
```

### Key behaviours
- Authentication session is persisted locally by the CLI — no token management needed in code
- Generation is asynchronous — always use `generate wait` before `generate get`
- Credits use the same system as the Higgsfield platform (Plus plan: unlimited image models)
- No API key in `.env` for Higgsfield — remove `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` entirely

## Build Phases

### Phase 1 — Script input + Claude scene analyzer ✅ COMPLETE
- Script paste/upload UI
- Project metadata form (title, niche, style preset, narrator tone)
- Claude API integration: script → scene JSON array
- Scene grid display with type badges and generated prompts
- Manual override: edit any scene's shot type or prompt before generation

**Deviations from original plan:**
- Model updated to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (original `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` deprecated June 2026)
- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` added to `.env` for local dev — Node.js does not trust the local CA certificate on this machine; must be removed before any production deployment
- Vite proxy (`/api → localhost:3001`) added to `client/vite.config.js`

### Phase 2 — Higgsfield image generation
- Loop through `image` scenes, call Higgsfield CLI via child_process
- Live generation progress grid (per-scene status: pending / generating / done / failed)
- Preview images inline per scene card
- Regenerate individual scenes
- Auto-download and save images to `/projects/[id]/assets/`

### Phase 3 — Clip library + matching
- Clip library browser UI (search, filter by category/mood/tags)
- Auto-match `real_footage` scenes against library tags
- Show top 3 candidates per scene, user picks or skips
- Fallback: auto-convert unmatched scenes to `image` type
- Gap logger: records unmatched tags to help grow the library

### Phase 4 — Remotion templates + Ken Burns
- Build all 5 motion graphic component templates
- Ken Burns implementation on ImageScene (varied zoom direction per scene to avoid repetition)
- Cross-dissolve transitions between scenes (8 frames)
- Audio track sync to scene durations

### Phase 5 — Full pipeline integration + render
- End-to-end flow: script in → MP4 out
- Render trigger via Remotion CLI from backend
- Export panel with progress indicator
- Download final MP4

---

## UI Design Principles
- Dark sidebar navigation (all modules listed, future ones marked "Coming soon")
- Clean minimal content area — no clutter
- Scene grid is the central UI metaphor: each card shows scene number, excerpt, type badge, prompt, and asset preview
- Status indicators on every async operation (analyzing, generating, matching, rendering)
- Non-destructive: every Claude or Higgsfield output is editable before the next step runs

---

## Environment Variables
Only one key needed in `.env`:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
Higgsfield authentication is managed by the CLI session — no key required.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist (before first run)
1. `npm install -g @higgsfield/cli` — install CLI globally
2. `higgsfield auth login` — authenticate once
3. `higgsfield account` — verify credits are available
4. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env`
5. Node.js 18+ installed
6. Remotion dependencies installed in `/remotion`

---

## Channel Benchmarks (for style reference)
- MagnatesMedia, Wendover Productions, Economics Explained
- Narrator tone: Keith Morrison / Peter Coyote — authoritative, measured, cinematic
- Visual identity: dark, clinical, high-contrast motion graphics

---

## Notes for Claude Code Sessions
- Always read this file at the start of a session before writing any code
- Never install libraries not listed in the tech stack without flagging it first
- Higgsfield is called via CLI (child_process), never via direct HTTP/REST
- All Higgsfield prompts must include the style lock string — injected in higgsfield.js service, not in the prompt itself
- Scene JSON is the contract between all modules — do not change its structure without updating all consumers
- Remotion and the backend are separate Node.js projects with their own package.json files
- Never hardcode API keys — always read from .env via dotenv

---

## Session Workflow Rules
These rules apply to every Claude Code session without exception.

### Rule 1 — Session opener
Every session must begin with:
> "Read PLAN.md first, then we'll continue from where we left off."
Never skip this. It rebuilds full context and prevents conflicting decisions across sessions.

### Rule 2 — Phase completion
When a phase is fully working and tested, run:
> "Update PLAN.md to mark Phase X as complete and note anything we changed from the original plan."
PLAN.md is the single source of truth. Keep it accurate as the build evolves.

### Rule 3 — Git discipline
- Run `git init` immediately after the scaffold is created
- Connect to GitHub: `gh repo create vorta --private --source=. --push`
- Commit message format: `phase-X: short description of what was built`
- Commit after every completed phase before moving to the next
- Never commit `.env` — it must be in `.gitignore` from day one

### Rule 4 — Phase testing checklist
Before marking any phase complete, run through its testing checklist (defined per phase below). Do not proceed to the next phase until all checks pass.
